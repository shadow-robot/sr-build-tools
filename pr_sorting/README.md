## Running the Code
To run the tool simply run the following command from any directory:

`source /PATH/TO/PR_SORTING/pr_sorting.bash`

This will create a virtual environment into the `pr_sorting/` directory and install necessary libraries.

The `pr_sorting.py` script will then be run.

After the script has finished the virtual environment will deactivate.

## Note on Personal Access Tokens
To run the script you will need access to a PAT owned by the Shadow-Robot Org on GitHub. This token will need read access to public and private repos.
